## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è HARDCODED FIREBASE API KEYS AND CREDENTIALS (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `src/firebase.js:7-12`

**Issue:**
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyB-9yZNPFFsjG8JR5t9i6ZbYZ9FnbZegw8",
  authDomain: "dred-e6e59.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "dred-e6e59",
  storageBucket: "dred-e6e59.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "901054214672",
  appId: "1:901054214672:web:d29954f1846e1b337d1095"
};
```

**Impact:** 
- Firebase API keys are exposed in client-side code
- Anyone can access and potentially abuse these credentials
- Could lead to unauthorized access to Firebase services
- Potential for data breaches and service abuse

**Recommendation:**
- Move sensitive configuration to environment variables
- Use Firebase App Check to verify requests
- Implement domain restrictions in Firebase Console
- Rotate exposed API keys immediately

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è HARDCODED MASTER PASSWORDS IN UTILITY SCRIPTS (CRITICAL)
**Locations:** 
- `utilities/get-cards.js:33`
- `utilities/add-test-transactions.js:22`
- `utilities/add-test-cards.js:188`

**Issue:**
```javascript
const masterPassword = 's'; // Encryption key
```

**Impact:**
- Weak hardcoded password ('s') used for encrypting sensitive card data
- Anyone with access to the repository can decrypt all stored card information
- Complete compromise of encryption security
- All encrypted card numbers, CVVs, and expiry dates are vulnerable

**Recommendation:**
- Remove all hardcoded passwords immediately
- Delete test/utility scripts from production codebase
- Implement proper key management
- Re-encrypt all existing data with secure keys

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è HARDCODED USER ID IN TEST SCRIPTS (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `utilities/add-test-cards.js:189`

**Issue:**
```javascript
const userId = 'GEFVXaVwmCMp12y8BxKnqUePLhF2'; // User ID
```

**Impact:**
- Exposes specific user account ID
- Attackers can target this specific user
- Reveals internal ID structure
- Privacy violation

**Recommendation:**
- Remove all test scripts from production repository
- Never commit real user IDs
- Use mock/fake data for testing
- Add .gitignore rules for test scripts

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è SENSITIVE DATA LOGGED TO CONSOLE (HIGH)
**Locations:**
- Multiple files log passwords, card numbers, and sensitive operations
- `src/MasterPasswordPrompt.jsx:110,158`
- `src/App.jsx:391,465`
- `utilities/add-test-cards.js:242`

**Issue:**
```javascript
console.log("MasterPasswordPrompt: Setting master password:", masterPass.substring(0, 1) + "******");
console.log(`Added card: ${cardType} from ${binInfo.Bank} with number ending in ${cardNumber.slice(-4)}`);
```

**Impact:**
- Sensitive information exposed in browser console
- Browser extensions can access console logs
- Debugging tools can capture this data
- Compliance violations (PCI-DSS)

**Recommendation:**
- Remove all console.log statements containing sensitive data
- Implement proper logging framework with sanitization
- Use environment-based logging (disable in production)
- Never log passwords, card numbers, CVVs, or personal data

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è WEAK ENCRYPTION IMPLEMENTATION (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `src/utils/security.js:136-157`

**Issue:**
```javascript
encryptData(data, key) {
  const cleanData = String(data || '');
  return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(cleanData, key).toString();
}

decryptData(encryptedData, key) {
  return CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, key)
    .toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}
```

**Impact:**
- No salt or IV (Initialization Vector) used
- Password is used directly as key without KDF (Key Derivation Function)
- No HMAC for integrity verification
- Vulnerable to rainbow table attacks
- Does not meet PCI-DSS encryption requirements

**Recommendation:**
- Implement PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2 for key derivation
- Use proper salt and IV for each encryption operation
- Add HMAC for integrity verification
- Consider using Web Crypto API instead of CryptoJS
- Store encryption metadata with ciphertext

---

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è INSUFFICIENT FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES (HIGH)
**Location:** `firestore.rules:35-39`

**Issue:**
```javascript
match /cards/{cardId} {
  allow read, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid;
  allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
}
```

**Impact:**
- No rate limiting enforced (function exists but not used)
- No data validation on updates
- No field-level restrictions
- No audit logging
- Users can modify any field including sensitive metadata

**Recommendation:**
- Implement rate limiting for write operations
- Add field-level validation
- Restrict which fields can be updated
- Add server-side timestamp validation
- Implement audit logging
- Add write size limits

---

### 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è WEAK PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS DISABLED (HIGH)
**Location:** `src/MasterPasswordPrompt.jsx:81-85`

**Issue:**
```javascript
// Temporarily disabled password requirements for development
// if (masterPass.length < 12 || !/[A-Z]/.test(masterPass) || !/[a-z]/.test(masterPass) || !/[0-9]/.test(masterPass) || !/[^A-Za-z0-9]/.test(masterPass)) {
//    setValidationError("Password does not meet requirements (12+ chars, upper, lower, number, special).");
//    return;
// }
if (masterPass.trim() === "") {
  setValidationError("Please enter a password.");
  return;
}
```

**Impact:**
- Users can set extremely weak passwords
- No complexity requirements enforced
- Comment suggests this is "temporary" but exists in production
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks
- Does not meet security best practices

**Recommendation:**
- Re-enable and enforce strong password requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Implement password strength meter
- Add password breach checking (Have I Been Pwned API)
- Never disable security features "temporarily"

---

### 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING CONTENT SECURITY POLICY (HIGH)
**Location:** No CSP headers found in configuration

**Issue:**
- No Content-Security-Policy headers configured
- No X-Frame-Options headers
- No X-Content-Type-Options headers
- No Referrer-Policy headers

**Impact:**
- Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- Vulnerable to clickjacking
- No protection against MIME-type sniffing
- Referrer information leakage

**Recommendation:**
Add security headers in `firebase.json`:
```json
"headers": [{
  "source": "**",
  "headers": [{
    "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
    "value": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://apis.google.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://*.googleapis.com https://*.firebaseio.com"
  }, {
    "key": "X-Frame-Options",
    "value": "DENY"
  }, {
    "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
    "value": "nosniff"
  }, {
    "key": "Referrer-Policy",
    "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  }]
}]
```

### 9. ‚ö†Ô∏è SENSITIVE DATA IN LOCALSTORAGE (MEDIUM)
**Locations:**
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx:239,273-274`
- `src/App.jsx:371,377`

**Issue:**
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('dred-theme', themePrefs.currentTheme);
localStorage.setItem('dred-color-mode', newMode);
```

**Impact:**
- While only theme data is currently stored, the pattern is dangerous
- localStorage is accessible to all scripts on the domain
- No encryption on localStorage data
- XSS vulnerabilities could expose this data
- Vulnerable to browser extensions

**Recommendation:**
- Never store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, card data) in localStorage
- Consider using sessionStorage for temporary data
- Implement proper session management on backend
- Use secure, httpOnly cookies for authentication tokens
- Encrypt any data stored client-side

---

### 10. ‚ö†Ô∏è INSUFFICIENT SESSION MANAGEMENT (HIGH)
**Location:** `src/utils/security.js:93-128`

**Issue:**
```javascript
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
```

**Impact:**
- Fixed 30-minute timeout may be too long for sensitive operations
- No automatic re-authentication for critical operations
- Session timeout is client-side only (can be bypassed)
- No server-side session validation
- No session invalidation on security events

**Recommendation:**
- Implement step-up authentication for sensitive operations
- Add server-side session management
- Reduce timeout for critical operations (viewing CVV, adding cards)
- Implement session invalidation on multiple failed attempts
- Add concurrent session detection
- Log all session creation/destruction events

---

### 11. ‚ö†Ô∏è INADEQUATE RATE LIMITING (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `src/utils/security.js:21-27`

**Issue:**
```javascript
RATE_LIMIT_MS = 1000; // 1 second

checkRateLimit() {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - this.lastOperation < RATE_LIMIT_MS) {
    throw new Error('Please wait before trying again');
  }
  this.lastOperation = now;
}
```

**Impact:**
- Client-side rate limiting only (easily bypassed)
- No server-side rate limiting
- 1 request per second is too permissive for password attempts
- No account lockout after multiple violations
- No logging of rate limit violations

**Recommendation:**
- Implement server-side rate limiting
- Use Firebase Security Rules rate limiting
- Reduce rate limits for authentication attempts
- Implement exponential backoff
- Add IP-based rate limiting
- Log and monitor rate limit violations

---

### 12. ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPOSED UTILITY SCRIPTS IN PRODUCTION (HIGH)
**Location:** `utilities/` directory

**Issue:**
- Test and utility scripts with hardcoded credentials
- Scripts that can modify production data
- No separation between development and production code

**Files:**
- `utilities/add-test-cards.js`
- `utilities/add-test-transactions.js`
- `utilities/delete-all-cards.js`
- `utilities/delete-all-transactions.js`
- `utilities/get-cards.js`

**Impact:**
- Exposed hardcoded credentials and user IDs
- Potential for unauthorized data manipulation
- Reveals application structure and vulnerabilities
- Could be used for malicious data injection

**Recommendation:**
- Remove all utility scripts from production repository
- Move to separate admin/development repository
- Never commit credentials or user IDs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper admin tools with authentication

While the application uses encryption, there's no explicit HTML sanitization before displaying decrypted data. This could lead to XSS if encrypted data is somehow compromised.

### 14. No Audit Logging
No comprehensive audit trail for:
- Card additions/deletions
- Password changes
- Failed authentication attempts
- Data access patterns

### 15. No Data Retention Policy
No automatic deletion or archival of old data, increasing attack surface.

### 16. Missing Security Monitoring
No implementation of:
- Anomaly detection
- Intrusion detection
- Security event logging
- Alert systems

---
