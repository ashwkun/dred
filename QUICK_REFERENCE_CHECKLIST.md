## Testing Checklist (After All Phases)

- [ ] Card list renders smoothly
- [ ] No memory leaks (check Chrome DevTools Memory tab)
- [ ] No console errors

## Migration Execution Checklist

### On Development Environment
```bash
# 1. Test migration dry-run
node utilities/migrate-card-data.js --dry-run

# 2. Review dry-run output
# Check: No errors, all cards detected

# 3. Run actual migration
node utilities/migrate-card-data.js --execute

# 4. Verify migration
node utilities/verify-migration.js <your-user-id> <your-master-password>

# 5. Test app functionality
npm run dev
# Test: Add card, view cards, delete card, etc.
```

### On Production Environment
```bash
# 1. Deploy to Firebase
npm run build
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only hosting

# 2. Have users re-login (will re-encrypt with new format)

# 3. Monitor Firestore for issues
# Check: New cards have cardNumberLast4 and cardNumberFull fields

# 4. After 7 days, verify all cards migrated
node utilities/verify-migration.js --all-users

# 5. After 30 days, clean up old cardNumber field (optional)
# Run script to remove old field from Firestore documents
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Something Goes Wrong)

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 hour after deployment)
```bash
# 1. Revert to previous deployment
firebase hosting:rollback

# 2. Revert Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
# (manually paste old rules from git)

# 3. Notify users via app banner
"Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in 5 minutes."
```

### Data Rollback (If migration corrupted data)
```bash
# 1. Restore Firestore from backup
# Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Import
# Select backup file from before migration

# 2. Revert code to old branch
git checkout main
git push origin main --force

# 3. Redeploy
npm run build
firebase deploy
```
