# Security Assessment Summary
## Dred - Digital Card Wallet

**Date:** October 4, 2025

---

## 🎯 Overall Security Score: **72/100**

**Rating:** GOOD (with critical issues to address)

---

## 🔒 What's Working Well

### Excellent Security Features ✅
1. **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - Industry-standard encryption properly implemented
2. **PBKDF2 Key Derivation** - 100,000 iterations (excellent strength)
3. **Non-Extractable CryptoKeys** - Keys cannot be exported from browser
4. **Master Password Never Stored** - Only used locally for encryption/decryption
5. **Secure Memory Wiping** - Automatic cleanup of sensitive data
6. **Firebase Authentication** - Proper OAuth2 and email/password auth
7. **Account Lockout** - 3 failed attempts = 15 min lockout
8. **Session Timeout** - 5 minutes of inactivity
9. **Firestore Security Rules** - Proper authorization checks
10. **Security Headers** - HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.

## ⚠️ Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 🔴 1. Content Security Policy with 'unsafe-eval'
**Risk:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Allows code injection attacks

**Current:**
```json
"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' ..."
```

**Fix:** Remove `'unsafe-eval'` and `'unsafe-inline'` from CSP

---

### 🔴 2. No Backend Security Layer
**Risk:** HIGH  
**Impact:** All security checks can be bypassed

**Problem:**
- All business logic runs client-side
- Rate limiting only on client (easily bypassed)
- No server-side validation
- No Cloud Functions

**Fix:** Implement Firebase Cloud Functions for sensitive operations

---

### 🔴 3. Exposed Firebase API Keys
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Potential unauthorized access without proper restrictions

**Current:** API keys hardcoded in source code
```javascript
apiKey: "AIzaSyB-9yZNPFFsjG8JR5t9i6ZbYZ9FnbZegw8"
```

**Fix:** 
- Configure domain restrictions in Firebase Console
- Enable App Check (requires paid plan)
- Add API key rotation schedule

---

### 🟡 4. Client-Side Rate Limiting
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Can be bypassed by determined attackers

**Fix:** Move rate limiting to backend (Cloud Functions or Firestore rules)

- [ ] Add security event logging
- [ ] Implement automated security tests

### Week 4: Documentation & Review
- [ ] Document security architecture
- [ ] Create threat model
- [ ] Review and test all changes

---

## 🏆 Target Score: 85/100 (within 6 months)

**To reach 85+:**
1. ✅ Fix all critical issues (Week 1-2)
2. ✅ Implement backend security layer (Week 2-3)
3. ✅ Add comprehensive monitoring (Week 3)
4. ✅ Enable App Check (requires paid plan)
5. ✅ Conduct penetration testing
6. ✅ Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD

---

## 💡 Quick Wins (Can implement today)

1. **Add npm audit to CI/CD**
   ```bash
   npm audit --audit-level=high
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase domain restrictions**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings
   - Add authorized domains only

3. **Add Snyk for dependency scanning**
   ```bash
   npm install -g snyk
   snyk test
   ```

4. **Remove 'unsafe-eval' if not needed**
   - Test app without it
   - If breaks, use nonces instead

---

## 🚀 Strengths to Maintain

Your encryption implementation is **excellent**. The following should be maintained:
- Encryption architecture (AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2)
- Non-extractable keys
- Secure memory wiping
- Master password model
- Client-side security controls

These are **best-in-class** for a client-side app!

---

## ⚠️ Compliance Notes

### PCI DSS
**Status:** ❌ NOT COMPLIANT  
**Recommendation:** Consider using tokenization (Stripe, Braintree) instead of storing full card numbers, OR achieve full PCI DSS compliance (expensive)

### GDPR
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLIANT  
**Missing:** Data export, automated deletion, consent management
